WELL got there at about 6 or so waited an hour just for them to bring my dog so he can leave after telling them many times we are waiting and no one has come. The Dr came in ( not the same dr who did surgery) and started saying that my dog may have internal bleeding or other serious issues. ( this was after we were told everything was fine) They wanted to give him fluids and run tests for 24 hours which would be about $350 more.

I pointed it out to the group and said \\\"Here it is\\\". Erick the sales associate then opened the door, looked at it, and nodded his head to the loader. He did not say a word to me, apologize for the inconvenience,  or even acknowledge that I was there when he was all about my experience 2 days prior when I was ready to spend some money. He looked at me one time as he was walking off and then turned to go back to the front of the store. He seemed more annoyed that I was in the store locating the fridge he clearly forgot to mark to be delivered to the back of the store. \\\"Solid\\\" customer experience, clearly he is there because it's a job that pays the bills, and it showed on the post purchase customer experience.

When we located the house we wanted Stephanie Ho told us to bring the check down in the form of a money order etc.... then our realtor got a call saying they rented the house out to someone else. After that we contested the situation and my wife was able to get her to keep her word. Since then I realized that they put an illegal clause in their lease agreement stating that I have to pay the first 35.00 of each repair (Even for normal wear and tear). Keep in mind I am in complete understanding that if a tenant breaks something in the house, that it is completely reasonable that they provide the first 35.00 dollars of each repair. However, the house we are renting was built in the late 70s and as ceiling fans started to break and outlets began to short out (while shooting sparks) I was reminded by, Lucy who handles maintenance, that I would be responsible for the first 35.00 dollars of each repair needed.   That just doesn't seem right to me, so I looked up my rights with the Texas Renter's Association and ran it by a lawyer who was a family friend and it turns out that they CANNOT charge you for normal wear and tear. The example the TRA gives is actually carpet and how they CANNOT charge you for traffic stains in the sense of replacing the whole carpet. They can only charge you for they typical shampoo and cleaning fee. Look it up people!! Anyway, I called Evergreen after I found this out and they said and I quote, \\\"Well sir, did you sign the lease?\\\". Basically saying it may be illegal, but you signed the document. I guess I need a lawyer to look over my rental agreements these days.  On top of that they send maintenance men to the wrong places, do not follow up requests etc...
