WELL got there at about 6 or so waited an hour just for them to bring my dog so he can leave after telling them many times we are waiting and no one has come. The Dr came in ( not the same dr who did surgery) and started saying that my dog may have internal bleeding or other serious issues. ( this was after we were told everything was fine) They wanted to give him fluids and run tests for 24 hours which would be about $350 more.

I pointed it out to the group and said \\\"Here it is\\\". Erick the sales associate then opened the door, looked at it, and nodded his head to the loader. He did not say a word to me, apologize for the inconvenience,  or even acknowledge that I was there when he was all about my experience 2 days prior when I was ready to spend some money. He looked at me one time as he was walking off and then turned to go back to the front of the store.

After that we contested the situation and my wife was able to get her to keep her word. Since then I realized that they put an illegal clause in their lease agreement stating that I have to pay the first 35.00 of each repair (Even for normal wear and tear). Keep in mind I am in complete understanding that if a tenant breaks something in the house, that it is completely reasonable that they provide the first 35.00 dollars of each repair. However, the house we are renting was built in the late 70s and as ceiling fans started to break and outlets began to short out (while shooting sparks) I was reminded by, Lucy who handles maintenance, that I would be responsible for the first 35.00 dollars of each repair needed.   That just doesn't seem right to me, so I looked up my rights with the Texas Renter's Association and ran it by a lawyer who was a family friend and it turns out that they CANNOT charge you for normal wear and tear. The example the TRA gives is actually carpet and how they CANNOT charge you for traffic stains in the sense of replacing the whole carpet. They can only charge you for they typical shampoo and cleaning fee. Look it up people!! Anyway, I called Evergreen after I found this out and they said and I quote, \\\"Well sir, did you sign the lease?\\\". Basically saying it may be illegal, but you signed the document.

I recently switched insurance policies and was dreading having to find a new dentist. After researching nearby facilities, I decided to give Trinity a try. The first thing that stood out was how clean and neat the waiting room was. I was instantly impressed. The friendly assistant then called me up to the counter for what I thought would be a pile of paperwork, but instead had me sign just a few forms on the computer, AMAZING! It was fast and simple, and within minutes I was being called to the back for my checkup. I was then met by Dr. Burakowski. She was young, and had a warm and inviting way about her that instantly made me feel comfortable. As I sat down in the chair we started talking about all kinds of stuff. It seemed like she had been my dentist for years. What's awesome about Dr. Burakowski is that she's someone you can relate to. She explains things in a simple way and doesn't try to talk over your head like some of the others. She has a great sense of humor, and doesn't mind conversing about topics other than teeth.

While she does a nice haircut, it was NOTHING like Iwanted.  The first cut was longer than I wanted, but decided to go with it due to her suggestion that I ease into shorter hair.  I made it about 3 weeks before I had to have it cut again.  Just couldn't deal with the length.  Guess that was my fault, I should have said something or been more specific (although I did show her what I wanted).  The second cut I was very specific about what I wanted.  Brought a picture and she agreed it was a good cut for my hair.  As we talked about the cut I specifically said that I did not like the front longer than the back (on me).  She said she would not do that.  She did.  The sides are all one length when they should have been layered.  When I asked her about it, she said something about if I wanted it that way we would do it next time and the sides might be too thin for it.  Then when I looked at the back, it was shorter in the middle and longer towards the face.  When I asked about it, she said she didn't want to mess up the lines.  I had time restraints and didn't have time to argue, so I thought I could deal with it.  I am now home from my trip and I just hate my hair.  She is supposed to be a Master stylist, for Pete's sake.  I paid $75.00, not once, but twice for a hair cut I didn't like.  Now, I am going to get my hair cut again.  But you can be assured it will not be at Smooth Lines.  It was a waste of my money.

Being told that I can get back to them the next day and that it might sell within the following 24 hours (which seemed very improbable but I understand since it's what business is like) I was given a few papers to sign. All I was told was that they're only \\\"Guest Forms\\\" and I went ahead and signed them. However the next day I decided against buying that. Apparently it was too late and they had already applied for a number of loans (at least two) on my behalf without even informing me. I only realized it when I received letters of denial from two different financial institutions a few days after that. And since I want a clean account history, these denials do not look good on my account. Not to mention that my credit card application was also turned down because of their loan requests. Now I have two big problems with this dealership: 1- The representative did not even bother to explain to me the procedure although she knew I am new the whole system(I only came here about a few months ago) and after I said I made my mind not to buy it, her tone and behavior changed completely( which is not a big deal again) 2-Someone in charge emailed me after my visit, following up and pretentiously asking about the service I had received and all that.

You dont sell a service to people by being rude and pushy. I definitely felt unwelcome everyday that I showed up to work out in the place. The people working out within the gym were fine, but the staff wasn't. The equipment ALWAYS has a fresh overpowering stench to them as they are rarely if ever maintained... Equipment has been broken for weeks at a time on several occasions. The bathroom/shower rooms do stink of mildew and not having soap to wash your hands and arms was normal (In the Men's section). Music was either too low or too loud. If you listen to your own music, good luck trying to hear it... or on some days if you dont have your own music, good luck again on hearing the music of the gym. Their water fountains are not filtered at all, you can taste all sorts of contaminates. Bringing your own towel/water/equipment is for your own survival in the place. I am not a picky person, I know this 24 hour is overcrowded with people, but to have such poor environment conditions consistently and for years is just neglect by the ownership. I could deal with most of these issues, but if you were ask me what bothered me most.... The staff being rude, pushy and pretty much self absorbed would be at the top of this horrible list.

I was very particular about the color and exact options I wanted.  Several other dealers responded quickly but only asked me to call them and offered no details.  Wayne Flohr of North Park sent me a price quote within minutes.  That car didn't exactly have all my options, so I called Wayne to discuss (I live in Austin so it was convenient to deal by email and phone.)  There was no pressure to buy from him, but my local Toyota dealer wasn't as helpful, so I went with North Park. Wayne then found the exact car I wanted, which hadn't yet been built but was scheduled to go to another dealer.  Wayne was able to intercept the car to North Park.  When the car was finally delivered about a month later, I was disappointed to learn that Wayne was no longer working at North Park.  Blaine Waddell was now assigned to this transaction.  I was happy to find that Blaine, like Wayne, was great to work with.  When we drove to San Antonio to take delivery, Blaine sat in the car with my wife and me for at least 1/2 hour, explaining all the controls and features, and he even linked our cell phones to the hands free communication system.  Blaine later followed up to make sure I was happy with the car, and I told him it was fantastic.  Later, I noticed a couple of missing tire valve stem covers, so Blaine promptly had a set of new ones shipped to me in Austin.  Then, I realized that the cargo net I ordered as an option, probably installed by Gulf States Toyota, didn't seem to be the correct size and was pretty much useless.  Blaine had the dealership ship me the correct one immediately.  Overall, fantastic service, not to mention the year of free unlimited car washes at the Wash Tub (there are two locations relatively near Austin) and a year of extra routine maintenance, if I want to drive to San Antonio for that.\", \"categories\": [\"Toyota Dealer\", \"Auto Body Shop\", \"Car Rental\"], \"gPlusPlaceId\": \"110943512930221092454\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1377379139, \"reviewTime\": \"Aug 24, 2013\", \"gPlusUserId\": \"100034408587495533126\", \"last_update_time\": 1706064704.745952}\n",

Besides racking up the daily late fees, Extra Space also slapped on an 85-dollar 'fine' which the counter folks could not explain how it was used only to say 'standard industry fee'.

Finally ended up paying $279.00 dollars on a unit that I normally pay 80 dollars on.   Spoke to a MGR in Kansas City who explained the 85 dollar fee went for 'auction fees and advertising' but 'Extra Space' was not allowed by law to make a profit on these auctions and therefore did not send the owner of the unit a check if the locker made more than thier trumped up 'fees and fines'.   Sure you are making a profit off hard working folk but you disguise it as 'fees'. As I explained to the Kansas MGR 'if you charge each person who goes late 85 dollars+assorted late fees, that is quite a price you must pay the auctioneer and you must advertise in the NY Times'.   Extra Space does make a profit off these foreclosed units, otherwise they would not slap on so many charges and fines to cover their tracks.

Made an appointment to have my car serviced, they said that it would only take 30 minutes. After about 2 and 1/2 hours I inquires what's taking them so long, I was told that my car was assigned to a mechanic who was not working that day. I then ask how long it would take after they found a mechanic who was working they told me about another hour or so. I was late for work and did not want to spend another 3 and 1/2 hours waiting for a 30 min. oil change so I said goodby. As I was walking out the door a sails rep stopped me  and ask if I was interested in a new car and I told the rep about my experience with the service shop. It was as if I was talking to the wall because the rep cut me off halfway and said that if I get a new car then it would last quite awhile without needing servicing.
