I went to multiple dealers and alot of them got my hopes up. when i came to pick up the car it was very clean, thanks to Ivan and Rick! and it showed they really wanted to make me happy! i would recommend buying a car from this dealer, very nice staff and very nice cars for a good price! Anfiona was very helpful when telling me about the different cars on the lot and Rachelle was able to lower down my monthly payment and that made me EXTREMELY happy!!!\", \"categories\": [\"Used Car Dealer\", \"Used Truck Dealer\"], \"gPlusPlaceId\": \"103741481690167833111\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1392679278.0, \"reviewTime\": \"Feb 17, 2014\", \"gPlusUserId\": \"100019030891065007480\", \"name\": \"Atlas Motors\", \"price\": \"\", \"address\": [\"5402 San Pedro Ave\", \"San Antonio, TX 78212\"], \"phone\": \"(210) 998-4888\", \"gps\": [29.483506, -98.498886], \"last_update_time\": 1706041326.9819021}\n",
