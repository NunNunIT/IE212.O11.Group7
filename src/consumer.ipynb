They said they would text me when it was ready (I was there for NCA Nationals) and they didn't.  The staff was rude.  I had to go back two times to find out if it was ready when I would have preferred to be with my child at her convention!  Then, I get to my room and it's right in front of the elevator.  Fabulous.  We went to eat at Texas Spice after the competition, the table was dirty and it took so long for a waitress to come we left.  Next year I will stay ANYWHERE but here and take a cab to the convention center.  I've stayed in a lot of upscale hotels.
