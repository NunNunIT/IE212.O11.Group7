{"rating": 5.0, "reviewerName": "Travis Beck", "reviewText": "This place is simple and delicious! They have played awesome music every time we go and their service is fantastic! Oh and by the way their sushi specials are ridiculously low priced during happy hour and on Sundays. The food is fantastic and be sure to ask the waitress about the house favorites....(ie.corral reef roll)! I am not sure where the picky reviews are coming from on here because I have tried several sushi places and this place is my new favorite!", "categories": ["Japanese Restaurant", "Sushi Restaurant", "Asian Restaurant"], "gPlusPlaceId": "111720054725155516080", "unixReviewTime": 1348153997.0, "reviewTime": "Sep 20, 2012", "gPlusUserId": "100010893718379981969", "last_update_time": 1706056926.2467928, "name": "Momiji Hibachi and Sushi", "price": "$$", "address": ["13201 Ranch Road 620 N", "Austin, TX 78717"], "phone": "(512) 219-7070", "gps": [30.467227, -97.794893]}
