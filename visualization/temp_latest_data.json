{"rating": 1.0, "reviewerName": "Appollo scott", "reviewText": "This place stinks I paid almost $5 for a super sonic cheese begrudger with no burger inside. When I called them to let them know that the meat was missing they just laugh as if he whole thing was a joke. Funny for them but not funny for the hungry guy writing this. The cook was too busy smoking weed and joking by the bathroom to realized that he was serving people bread with no meat. TO ALL STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.", "categories": ["Restaurant", "Fast Food Restaurant"], "gPlusPlaceId": "107096252454222155953", "unixReviewTime": 1333166112.0, "reviewTime": "Mar 30, 2012", "gPlusUserId": "100042460923905660123", "last_update_time": 1706065606.3340926, "name": "Sonic Drive-In", "price": "$$$", "address": ["5303 John David Dr", "Killeen, TX 76549"], "phone": "(254) 628-8003", "gps": [31.094013, -97.806413]}
